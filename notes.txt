->> Summary of Key Differences b/w npm and npx:
1. npm installs and manages packages, while npx is used to run packages directly.
2. With npx, you donâ€™t need to install the package globally, making it useful for one-time package executions.
3. npm is better suited for managing dependencies within a project, while npx is ideal for one-off usage of tools or utilities without cluttering your environment.

->> Routinhg:
    BrowserRouter (as Router): This component enables client-side routing. It keeps the UI in sync with the URL in the browser. Without BrowserRouter, React apps would
rely on full-page reloads to navigate between different routes or URLs.
It listens to changes in the browser's address bar and renders the appropriate components based on the URL path.
    Switch: The Switch component ensures that only one route is rendered at a time. It renders the first Route that matches the URL and ignores the rest. Without Switch,
multiple Route components could match and render simultaneously if their paths overlap.

->> "Routes" allows seamless nested routing which might be problematic for "Switch"

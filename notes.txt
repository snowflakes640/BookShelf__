->> Summary of Key Differences b/w npm and npx:
1. npm installs and manages packages, while npx is used to run packages directly.
2. With npx, you donâ€™t need to install the package globally, making it useful for one-time package executions.
3. npm is better suited for managing dependencies within a project, while npx is ideal for one-off usage of tools or utilities without cluttering your environment.

->> Routinhg:
    BrowserRouter (as Router): This component enables client-side routing. It keeps the UI in sync with the URL in the browser. Without BrowserRouter, React apps would
rely on full-page reloads to navigate between different routes or URLs.
It listens to changes in the browser's address bar and renders the appropriate components based on the URL path.
    Switch: The Switch component ensures that only one route is rendered at a time. It renders the first Route that matches the URL and ignores the rest. Without Switch,
multiple Route components could match and render simultaneously if their paths overlap.

->> "Routes" allows seamless nested routing which might be problematic for "Switch"

->> useCallback Hook
useCallback is a React hook that memoizes a function so that it is only recreated when one of its dependencies changes.
In this case, the function fetchBooks will be recreated only when searchTerm changes.
The purpose is to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-creations of the function on every render.

->> Asynchronous Function fetchBooks
fetchBooks is an asynchronous function, meaning it uses the async keyword, allowing it to wait for asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API.
It is used here to fetch book data based on a search term.
